## Lab Question Answers
## PART 1
Question 1: What is dBm? What values are considered good and bad for WiFi signal strength?
dBm, which stands for decibel miliwatts, is a unit of power that is used to express signals –relative to 1mW– in a 
logarithmic scale. Values that are considered good for WiFi are around -30 to -70dBm, whereas those below are not 
(mainly starting at -80dBm).

Question 2: Why do we need to check the OS? What is the difference between the commands for each OS?
This is because each OS has its own tools and command prompts, as well as because a lot of applications are written 
for a specific OS. The main difference between commans lies in syntax differences, as well as in the use of longer 
paths for utilities (eg. macOS) versus flexible CLI tools (eg. Linux).

Question 3: In your own words, what is subprocess.check_output doing? What does it return? 
(HINT: https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.check_output)
This line of code runs a command in the system's shell and then returns what is printed by the command in standard
output (stdout).

Question 4: In your own words, what is re.search doing? What does it return? 
(HINT: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.search)
This line of code takes the output generated by subprocess.check_output and goes through it in order to find a specific 
pattern (which in this case corresponds to the signal level). It then returns all the matches found within the previously 
returned object.

Question 5: In the Windows case, why do we need to convert the signal quality to dBm?
(HINT: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wlanapi/ns-wlanapi-wlan_association_attributes?)
This is because (as mentioned in Q1) not all OSs have the same commands. In this case, Windows returns the signal strength 
as a percentage. Thus, the object 'signal_quality' has to be converted to the logarithmic scale corresponded to dBm.

Question 6: What is the standard deviation? Why is it useful to calculate it?
The standard deviation is a measure of how spread out a given set of numbers are. Its useful because it effectively reflects 
how much the individual data points differ from the measured mean.

Question 7: What is a dataframe? Why is it useful to use a dataframe to store the data?
(HINT: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html, print the dataframe 
to see what it looks like)
Essentially, a dataframe is a 2-dimensional Python data table provided by the Pandas library. More specifically for our case,
'df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['location', 'signal_strength_mean', 'signal_strength_std'])' creates a data table containing the 
location and the signal strength mean and standard deviation of the data. It's more useful it simplifies the processing of data with 
respect to other Python objects.

Question 8: Why is it important to plot the error bars? What do they tell us?
This is important because it gives additional information regarding the data sampels –more specifically, giving information about 
how reliable each point is, and thus how uncertain the measurements are.

Question 9: What did you observe from the plot? How does the signal strength change as you move between 
locations? Why do you think signal strength is weaker in certain locations?
As can be seen in the graph, the WiFi strength signal is stronger in the Bedroom and Bathroom, while appearing weaker in the rest of 
rooms (such as the Kitchen). This is likely because the rooms showing stronger signals were closer to the WiFi router than the rest 
of rooms. This is why we see different dBm measurements in each room.

## PART 2
Question 1: How does distance affect TCP and UDP throughput?
In general, we can see that as the distance increases, the throughput for TCP decreases significantly. While this is also the case 
for UDP, it can be seen to drop at a slower rate than TCP.

Question 2: At what distance does significant packet loss occur for UDP?
While the throughput for UDP stays constant at 10 for most distances, at a distance of 10m (that is, the largest distance) it drops 
even lower than it already was.

Question 3: Why does UDP experience more packet loss than TCP?
This is because UDP is a connectionless protocol. Thus, not using retransmissions or acknowledgements means that the loss in UDP 
accumulates, whereas TCP is able to adjust thanks to its error recovering mechanisms.

Question 4: What happens if we increase the UDP bandwidth (-b 100M)?
If we were to increase the UDP bandwidth but left the link capacity as is, one could risk losing even more packages than before. This 
is because UDP will be sending packages at a faster rate, but the WiFi link will not be accepting packages as fast. Thus, the lack of 
feedback of UDP will result in a lower throughput.

Question 5: Would performance be different on 5 GHz Wi-Fi vs. 2.4 GHz?
Yes. This is because the wavelengths used for the different WiFi links are different (the former has a shorter wavelength, for 
instance). These characteristics affect how the signals travel. This means that when using the 5GHz WiFi, the signals closer to the 
router will perform better (as it allows for a higher throughput but only at short ranges since the signals don't travel as far) 
whereas the 2.4GHz WiFi –while not allowing for higher throughputs due to the lower frequency of the link– will perform better at 
longer distances (in this case, for more rooms).
